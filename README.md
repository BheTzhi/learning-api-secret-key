# Endpoints

Here are the available API routes:

## Public Endpoints
* **Get All Students**: `GET /mahasiswa`
    Retrieves a list of all students.
* **Get All Departments**: `GET /jurusan`
Retrieves a list of all departments.

* **Get All Courses**: `GET /matakuliah`
Retrieves a list of all courses.

* **Get Student by ID**: `GET /mahasiswa/{id}`
Retrieves a specific student by ID.

* **Get Department by ID**: `GET /jurusan/{id}`
Retrieves a specific department by ID.

* **Get Course by ID**: `GET /matakuliah/{id}`
Retrieves a specific course by ID.

## Private Endpoint
* **Get Student KHS**: `GET /mahasiswa/khs`
This endpoint requires authentication using API key and semester information.

Headers:
* `X-API-KEY` (The API key stored in the mahasiswa table in your database)
* `X-API-SEMESTER` (Optional, semester information)

Query Parameters:
* `nim` (Student NIM)

Example Request (Postman):
```bash
GET htt://127.0.0.1:8000/mahasiswa/khs?nim=12345
```

Headers:
* `X-API-KEY: your_api_key`
* `X-API-SEMESTER: 4` (1-8 or null optional)

## Middleware
The `/mahasiswa/khs` endpoint is protected by the `verify.mahasiswa` middleware. This middleware verifies the student's identity by checking the `X-API-KEY` header against the key stored in the `mahasiswa` table and validates the `nim` query parameter.

## Where to Find `X-API-KEY`
The `X-API-KEY` is generated and stored in the `mahasiswa` table in the database. This key is assigned when the student record is created and can be retrieved by querying the `mahasiswa` table for the corresponding student's record. Ensure that this key is kept secure and used properly in the headers for authenticated requests.

## Example Request Using Postman
To test the endpoints, you can use Postman by sending requests with the appropriate headers.

* Get All Students:
    `GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/mahasiswa`

* Get Student KHS:
    `GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/mahasiswa/khs?nim=12345`
    Headers:
    *`X-API-KEY: your_api_key`
    *`X-API-SEMESTER: 2025-1 (optional)`
